# LibraryManagementSystem
Full Stack Web Development Capstone Project

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, if libraries often rely on manual methods to track books, users, and transactions, can lead to misplaced items, delays, and frustration for both staff and visitors. The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly, web-based system that automates key processes like borrowing, returning, and inventory management.
By reducing paperwork and providing real-time data, librarians can focus on delivering better service and an improved user experience.
